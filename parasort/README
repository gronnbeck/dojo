- Introduction
A small, and unfinished,  project that I worked on to help me parallelize sorting
of files on UNIX machines. If I do not update this script it is either because
I have completely forgot about it, or I have not had time to do it.


- version 0.1 alpha
Is able to parallelize sorting into two cpus if the number of lines in the files
is even. The program failes if the number of lines are odd.
